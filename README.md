# Training on web crawling

If you want to run JavaScript code in the context of a webpage and scrape data using a tool like VSCode, you can use browser developer tools to run your script. Here's how you can do it:

Open the webpage in your browser.
Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Opt+I (Mac) to open the developer tools.
Go to the "Console" tab in the developer tools.
Now, you can paste your JavaScript code directly into the console and run it.

Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
// URL to fetch data from
const url = 'http://www.numericana.com/data/partition.htm';

// Fetch the HTML content of the page
fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(html => {
        // Create a temporary div element to parse the HTML
        const tempDiv = document.createElement('div');
        tempDiv.innerHTML = html;

        // Find the <pre> element (assuming the data is in a <pre> tag)
        const dataSection = tempDiv.querySelector('pre');

        // Extract text content from <pre> tag
        const dataText = dataSection.textContent || dataSection.innerText;

        // Split the text into lines and find the line containing '14: 135'
        const lines = dataText.split('\n');
        const resultLine = lines.find(line => line.includes('14: 135'));

        // Print the result
        console.log(resultLine);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    });
Copy and paste this code into the browser console, and it should execute the scraping script.

If you want to integrate this into your VSCode workflow, you might need to consider using a server-side approach with a tool like Node.js and the puppeteer library for headless browsing. This allows you to run a headless browser in the background and programmatically interact with web pages. However, keep in mind that web scraping should always be done responsibly and in accordance with the website's terms of service.



here's an example of how you can use Node.js and the Puppeteer library for headless browsing to scrape data:

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using the terminal.

Run the following commands to initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies (Puppeteer):

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install puppeteer
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., scrape.js) in your project directory and add the following code:
javascript
Copy code
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

async function scrapeData() {
  // Launch a headless browser
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();

  // Open a new page
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to the URL
  await page.goto('http://www.numericana.com/data/partition.htm');

  // Extract the text content of the <pre> tag
  const data = await page.$eval('pre', pre => pre.textContent);

  // Split the text into lines and find the line containing '14: 135'
  const lines = data.split('\n');
  const resultLine = lines.find(line => line.includes('14: 135'));

  // Print the result
  console.log(resultLine);

  // Close the browser
  await browser.close();
}

// Run the scraping function
scrapeData();
Run the script using the following command:
bash
Copy code
node scrape.js
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, navigate to the specified URL, extract the text content of the <pre> tag, and find the line containing '14: 135'. Make sure to adjust the selector and logic according to the structure of the HTML on the webpage you are working with.

Keep in mind that web scraping should be done responsibly, and you should comply with the website's terms of service. Additionally, web scraping can put a load on the server, so consider adding delays between requests to avoid overloading the server.




To display the scraped information in a user interface (UI), you can use a web framework along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this example, I'll guide you on how to create a simple HTML page with a button to trigger the scraping process and display the result.

Create an HTML file (index.html):
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Scraping UI</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Data Scraping UI</h1>
<button onclick="scrapeData()">Scrape Data</button>
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
    async function scrapeData() {
        const response = await fetch('/scrape');
        const result = await response.text();
        document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = result;
    }
</script>

</body>
</html>
This HTML file includes a button with an onclick attribute that calls the scrapeData function when clicked. The result of the scraping will be displayed in a <div> with the id "result."

Create a Node.js server (server.js):
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/scrape', async (req, res) => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    
    await page.goto('http://www.numericana.com/data/partition.htm');
    const data = await page.$eval('pre', pre => pre.textContent);

    const lines = data.split('\n');
    const resultLine = lines.find(line => line.includes('14: 135'));

    await browser.close();

    res.send(resultLine || 'Data not found');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
This Node.js script uses the Express.js framework to create a simple server. It includes a single route /scrape, which performs the scraping using Puppeteer and sends back the result.

Run the Node.js server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You should see your HTML page.

Click the "Scrape Data" button to trigger the scraping process. The result will be displayed on the page.

This is a basic example, and you may want to enhance it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, make sure to handle errors and consider implementing more sophisticated error handling and loading indicators for a better user experience.# crawling
